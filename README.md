# Airline Passenger Satisfaction â€“ MLP Classifier (Google Colab)

This project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict airline passenger satisfaction from tabular data, trained and visualized in a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)
- Data includes features such as seat comfort, flight distance, delays, and onboard services
- Binary classification: `Satisfied` vs `Neutral or Dissatisfied`

## ðŸ§  Model

- **Architecture**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch
- Input preprocessing: label encoding, feature scaling
- Model evaluation: accuracy, F1-score

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Google Colab (Python 3, Jupyter Notebook)
- PyTorch
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ How to Run

You can open and run the notebook in Google Colab:
